## 1. AI Modeling Service

### **Business Intent**

**Enterprise Architecture Capability**: AI-assisted enterprise architecture modeling that accelerates the creation of ArchiMate elements from natural language descriptions and business requirements.

**Business Process Supported**:
```
Business Requirements → Natural Language Input → AI Processing → ArchiMate Elements → Feedback Loop → Model Refinement
```

**Stakeholders**:
- **Enterprise Architects**: Accelerate modeling through AI assistance
- **Business Analysts**: Convert requirements to architectural elements
- **Solution Architects**: Generate solution architectures from descriptions
- **Transformation Teams**: Rapid prototyping of architectural models

### **Current Implementation**

**Functional Endpoints**:
- `POST /ai_modeling/generate` - Core AI generation endpoint
- `GET /ai_modeling/history/{user_id}` - User modeling history
- `POST /ai_modeling/feedback` - Feedback collection
- `GET /health` - Health monitoring
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

**Currently Functional Features**:
✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of tenant_id, user_id, input_type, and input_text
✅ **Authentication**: Multi-tenant authentication with proper error handling
✅ **Database Operations**: CRUD operations with graceful fallback
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Framework in place (stubbed implementation)
✅ **Audit Logging**: Event emission for modeling activities
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed error messages
✅ **Fallback Logic**: Service continues operating even with database failures

**Stubbed/Missing Components**:
❌ **LLM Integration**: Currently using mock responses instead of real AI services

ModelingInput {
  id: Integer (PK)
  tenant_id: String (indexed)
  user_id: String (indexed)
  input_type: String (goal, initiative, kpi, canvas, architecture_text)
  input_text: String
  created_at: DateTime
}

-- ModelingOutput Entity
ModelingOutput {
  id: Integer (PK)
  input_id: Integer (FK to ModelingInput)
  layer: String (Strategy, Business, Application, Technology)
  elements: JSON (List[Dict] of ArchiMate elements)

2. **Service Integration**: Complete integration between related services
3. **External Dependencies**: Integrate with external services (LLM, Stripe, etc.)
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement domain-specific business logic

### **Production Readiness**

**Current Status**: 🔄 **Development Ready** - Services have solid foundations but need critical business functionality

**Timeline to Production**:
- **AI Modeling Service**: 2-3 weeks (LLM integration + audit)
