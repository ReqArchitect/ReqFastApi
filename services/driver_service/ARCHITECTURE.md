# Driver Service Architecture

## Overview

The Driver Service is a microservice within the ReqArchitect platform that manages ArchiMate 3.2 Driver elements. It provides comprehensive driver lifecycle management with influence mapping, strategic analysis, and cross-layer traceability capabilities.

## ArchiMate 3.2 Alignment

### Layer: Motivation Layer
**Element**: Driver
**Purpose**: Represents external or internal influences that shape enterprise strategy

### Key Relationships
- **Driver → Goal**: Drivers influence goal setting and prioritization
- **Driver → Requirement**: Drivers shape requirement definition
- **Driver → Capability**: Drivers influence capability development
- **Driver → Business Actor**: Drivers affect business actor behavior

## Domain Model

### Core Entities

#### Driver
The primary entity representing an ArchiMate 3.2 Driver element.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `tenant_id`: Multi-tenant isolation
- `user_id`: Creator/owner
- `name`: Driver name
- `description`: Detailed description
- `driver_type`: Business, technical, regulatory, environmental, social
- `category`: Internal, external, strategic, operational
- `urgency`: Low, medium, high, critical
- `impact_level`: Low, medium, high, critical
- `source`: Origin of the driver
- `stakeholder_id`: Associated stakeholder
- `business_actor_id`: Associated business actor
- `strategic_priority`: 1-5 scale
- `time_horizon`: Short-term, medium-term, long-term
- `geographic_scope`: Local, regional, national, global
- `compliance_required`: Whether compliance is mandatory
- `risk_level`: Low, medium, high, critical
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

#### DriverLink
Represents relationships between drivers and other ArchiMate elements.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `driver_id`: Associated driver
- `linked_element_id`: Target element ID
- `linked_element_type`: Type of linked element
- `link_type`: Influences, drives, constrains, enables
- `link_strength`: Weak, medium, strong
- `influence_direction`: Positive, negative, neutral
- `created_by`: User who created the link
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Complete tenant isolation via `tenant_id` scoping
- All queries filtered by tenant
- JWT-based tenant identification

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Redis-based event emission
- Events for all CRUD operations
- Integration with event bus service

### Observability
- Structured JSON logging
- Prometheus metrics
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints

### Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation via Pydantic
- SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
- Standard CRUD operations
- Consistent URL patterns
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error handling

### Validation
- Pydantic-based request/response validation
- Enum-based constraint validation
- Field-level validation rules

### Pagination and Filtering
- Offset-based pagination
- Multi-field filtering
- Consistent response formats

## Business Logic

### Driver Lifecycle
1. **Identification**: External/internal influences identified
2. **Analysis**: Impact and urgency assessment
3. **Mapping**: Links to other elements established
4. **Monitoring**: Ongoing influence tracking
5. **Review**: Periodic reassessment

### Influence Mapping
- Links to other ArchiMate elements
- Influence direction analysis
- Strategic impact scoring
- Cross-layer traceability

### Strategic Analysis
- Urgency and impact assessment
- Risk level calculation
- Compliance status tracking
- Strategic alignment evaluation

## Integration Points

### Event Bus Service
- Emits events for driver changes
- Enables cross-service communication
- Supports audit trail

### Architecture Suite
- Links drivers to architecture packages
- Enables cross-layer traceability
- Supports strategic analysis

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Health status reporting
- Metrics aggregation
- Alert integration

## Data Flow

### Create Driver
1. Validate input data
2. Create driver record
3. Emit creation event
4. Return driver data

### Update Driver
1. Validate input data
2. Update driver record
3. Emit update event
4. Return updated data

### Delete Driver
1. Validate permissions
2. Delete driver record
3. Emit deletion event
4. Return success response

### Link Management
1. Validate driver exists
2. Create link record
3. Emit link creation event
4. Return link data

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT token validation
- Token expiration handling
- Secure token storage

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Permission matrix
- Tenant isolation

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed foreign keys
- Efficient query patterns
- Connection pooling

### Caching Strategy
- Redis-based caching
- Cache invalidation
- Performance monitoring

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing ready
- Stateless design

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
- Request counts and latencies
- Error rates
- Business metrics

### Logging
- Structured JSON logs
- Correlation IDs
- Audit trail

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing
- Span correlation
- Performance analysis

## Deployment

### Containerization
- Docker-based deployment
- Multi-stage builds
- Environment configuration

### Environment Variables
- Database configuration
- Redis configuration
- Security settings

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- Service health
- Dependency status
