# Driver Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the `driver_service` microservice for the ReqArchitect platform, representing the ArchiMate 3.2 "Driver" element within the Motivation Layer. The service provides comprehensive driver lifecycle management with influence mapping, strategic analysis, and cross-layer traceability capabilities.

## Business Purpose

The Driver Service captures external and internal influences that shape enterprise strategy and decision-making. It enables organizations to:

- **Track Strategic Influences**: Monitor business, technical, regulatory, environmental, and social drivers
- **Map Influence Networks**: Understand how drivers affect goals, requirements, capabilities, and business actors
- **Analyze Strategic Impact**: Assess urgency, impact, risk, and compliance implications
- **Support Decision Making**: Provide data-driven insights for strategic planning
- **Ensure Compliance**: Track regulatory and compliance drivers across the enterprise

## ArchiMate 3.2 Alignment

**Layer**: Motivation Layer
