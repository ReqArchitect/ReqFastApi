# Constraint Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

The `constraint_service` microservice has been successfully implemented to represent the ArchiMate 3.2 "Constraint" element within the Motivation Layer. This service provides comprehensive constraint lifecycle management with impact mapping, compliance tracking, and cross-layer traceability capabilities.

## Business Purpose

The Constraint Service captures restrictions, boundaries, and limitations that shape or restrict business goals, architectural design, and operational execution. It enables organizations to:

- **Track Regulatory Compliance**: Monitor GDPR, SOX, ISO, and other regulatory frameworks
- **Manage Technical Constraints**: Document system limitations and technical boundaries
- **Assess Business Impact**: Analyze how constraints affect business operations
- **Enable Cross-Layer Traceability**: Link constraints to Goals, Requirements, Capabilities, and other ArchiMate elements
- **Support Risk Management**: Track risk profiles and mitigation strategies

## ArchiMate 3.2 Alignment

### Layer: Motivation Layer
**Element**: Constraint
**Purpose**: Represents restrictions, boundaries, and limitations that shape enterprise strategy

### Key Relationships Implemented:
- **Constraint → Goal**: Constraints limit or shape goal achievement
- **Constraint → Requirement**: Constraints define requirement boundaries
- **Constraint → Capability**: Constraints restrict capability development
- **Constraint → Application Component**: Constraints limit application design

- By severity (low, medium, high, critical)
- By stakeholder or business actor
- By affected element type and ID
- Compliance-required constraints
- Expiring constraints
