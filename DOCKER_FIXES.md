# Docker Container Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` and related Docker container issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Analytics Service**
- **Problem**: Dockerfile was in wrong location (`app/Dockerfile` instead of root)
- **Problem**: Wrong CMD (`main:app` instead of `app.main:app`)
- **Problem**: Missing requirements.txt
- **Problem**: Relative imports instead of absolute imports
- **Problem**: Missing health endpoint

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Moved Dockerfile to correct location (`services/analytics_service/Dockerfile`)
- ✅ Fixed CMD to use `app.main:app`
- ✅ Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Fixed imports to use absolute imports (`from app import models`)
- ✅ Added health endpoint at `/health`

### 2. **Feedback Service**
- **Problem**: Missing Dockerfile entirely
- **Problem**: Missing requirements.txt
- **Problem**: Relative imports instead of absolute imports
- **Problem**: Missing health endpoint

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created Dockerfile with correct structure
- ✅ Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Fixed imports to use absolute imports
- ✅ Added health endpoint at `/health`

### 3. **Event Bus Service**
- **Problem**: Missing Dockerfile entirely
- **Problem**: Missing requirements.txt
- **Problem**: Relative imports instead of absolute imports
- **Problem**: Missing health endpoint

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created Dockerfile with correct structure
- ✅ Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies (including redis)
- ✅ Fixed imports to use absolute imports
- ✅ Added health endpoint at `/health`

### 4. **Auth Service**
- **Problem**: Empty requirements.txt
- **Problem**: Missing health endpoint

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added all necessary dependencies to requirements.txt
- ✅ Added health endpoint at `/health`

### 5. **Other Services**
- **Problem**: Missing or incomplete requirements.txt files
- **Problem**: Missing health endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt for all services with consistent versions
- ✅ Added health endpoints to all services

## Dockerfile Structure

All services now use the correct Dockerfile structure:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## Requirements.txt Dependencies

All services now include these core dependencies:

```
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
sqlalchemy==2.0.23
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
pydantic==2.5.0
python-multipart==0.0.6
```

Additional dependencies for specific services:
- **Auth Service**: `passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4`, `python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0`
- **Event Bus Service**: `redis==5.0.1`, `requests==2.31.0`
- **Notification Service**: `requests==2.31.0`
- **Gateway Service**: `httpx==0.25.2`, `starlette==0.27.0`

## Import Structure

All services now use absolute imports:

```python
# ✅ Correct
from app import models, schemas
from app.database import SessionLocal, engine

# ❌ Incorrect (fixed)
from . import models, schemas
from .database import SessionLocal, engine
```

## Health Endpoints

All services now include a health endpoint at `/health`:

```python
@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "service": "service_name"}
```

## Docker Compose Updates

Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include:
- ✅ Added missing services (analytics, feedback, event_bus_service)
- ✅ Fixed build paths for services with Dockerfiles in app subdirectory
- ✅ Added proper dependencies between services
- ✅ Added health checks for all services

## Testing

Created `test_docker_build.py` to verify that all services can build successfully.

## Services Fixed

1. ✅ analytics_service
2. ✅ feedback_service
3. ✅ event_bus_service
4. ✅ auth_service
5. ✅ ai_modeling_service
6. ✅ usage_service
7. ✅ onboarding_state_service
8. ✅ audit_log_service
9. ✅ notification_service
10. ✅ billing_service
11. ✅ invoice_service
12. ✅ gateway_service

## Next Steps

1. Run `python test_docker_build.py` to verify all builds work
2. Run `docker-compose up` to test the full stack
3. Test health endpoints: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` for each service
4. Verify all services respond correctly to health checks

## Notes

- All services now follow the same structure and patterns
- Health endpoints are consistent across all services
- Dependencies are properly versioned and consistent
- Docker builds should now work without `ModuleNotFoundError`
- Services are properly integrated in docker-compose.yml
